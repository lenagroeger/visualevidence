1. multi-queue, multiple cashier
2. single queue, multiple shared cashier
3. single queue, one cashier

	•Single server: customers line up and there is only one server
	•Parallel servers: customers line up and there are several servers
	•Tandem queue: there are many counters and customers can decide going where to queue



1. Actually Clocktime
2. Psychology (perceived speed, feel losing to people more than beating them, mirrors for distraction)
3. Fairness. No cutting! But express lanes are OK (will take less time), and priority lines OK (emergency room, more deserved, still contemptment for TSA PreCheck)


Incentives: 
1. First in, first out (encourages longer waiting)
2. Last in, first out (encourages less waiting) 


What you know
Displays of clocks/time left
Call-back services, buzzing pagers (so you can do something else)



FROM SLATE:
1) We get bored when we wait in line. 
2) We really hate it when we expect a short wait and then get a long one. 
3) We really, really hate it when someone shows up after us but gets served before us.
